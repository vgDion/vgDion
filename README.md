  I am a cybersecurity student. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fUqv7zNVW2QaHqEgSg/giphy.gif" width="30">



🧠 I’m a cybersecurity student with hands-on experience in vulnerability analysis, secure software development, and runtime sandboxing.  
🔬 I’m currently researching WebAssembly security and attack vectors in Kubernetes-based runtimes.  
🛠️ My projects include tools for SSRF detection, process monitoring.  
🌐 Actively learning DevSecOps, SOC operations, and cloud-native security.
